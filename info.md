## Bugs and Ideas

### Side Bar 
- Needs to be in a fixed position
- May have to wait until a complete overhaul eventually, currently breaks upon implementation

### Education Dropdown
- Currently works as intended from the second click on, not sure why the first click is currently being ignored.
- > Will need to do some console.log and event listening testing 
- Should be able to click on the edu-card and that result in a drop down not just the chevron
- Put a transition delay on showing the edu-description
- Make the chevron flip from down to up after being clicked
- Some sort of light hover effects unless actively dropped

### Contact Form
- Form is prototyped in a second folder
- Will need to learn google firebase or something along those lines probably

### Upon Entry
- Have a small animation upon entry to the site
